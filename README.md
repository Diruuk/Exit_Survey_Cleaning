<p>Clean and analyze employee exit survey</p>

<p>In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.</p> 

<p>In this project, we'll be a data analyst and our stakeholders would like to know the following:</p>

* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

<p>A data dictionary wasn't provided with the dataset. For this project, we'll use our general knowledge to define the columns.</p>
